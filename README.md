# Vulkan-Spinning-Cube

This project is a minimal C++20 application that demonstrates how to render a rotating 3D cube using the Vulkan graphics API. It is designed for educational purposes and as a starting point for more complex Vulkan-based applications.

---

## Features

- **Vulkan API**: Modern, explicit graphics API for high-performance rendering.
- **GLFW**: Cross-platform window and input management.
- **GLM**: Mathematics library for graphics software (vectors, matrices, transformations).
- **C++20**: Uses modern C++ features for clarity and safety.
- **Rotating Cube**: Renders a colored, indexed 3D cube with basic camera and transformation logic.
- **Validation Layers**: Optional Vulkan validation for debugging and learning.
